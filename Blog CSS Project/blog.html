	Whether one is watching a thrilling thunderstorm or looking up at a mighty tree, the experience of nature is one of awe. One cannot help but marvel at the intricate design of a single leaf, or the roar of a great waterfall. Time spent in nature is time spent realizing that you don't know it all and that you never will. The earth is meant to be enjoyed by its inhabitants. That includes keeping it in the pristine condition in which it was discovered. Everyone has a part of the earth that they relate to the most. Whether it is a majestic mountain range, a roaring waterfall, a bouquet of flowers, or the calm of the woods, these are places to get to know oneself and build bonds with family.

	<p>I walk through the garden,On this warm summer's day,To smell the flowers,That grandma raised.In the middle,Of this garden of gold,Stood this one,Single red stem rose,The rose means so many things,From the ones you receive on your wedding day,To the one you get on Valentine's Day,But this single rose standing here today,Represents the love grandma gave.</p>

	<p>As I look out to my gardenI feel a sense of prideIt really is a lovely roomExcept it is outside.Where lovely things mix and matchAnd greenery fills the wallsThe sound of trickling waterComing from the gold fish pond.I love the sight of stones and rocksAnd driftwood and tree ferns tooThe sounds of all my chimesI know you would like it too.</p>
